Problem:

Inconvenience is caused to citizens who has to visit government offices and register for various services and buy different stamps, notarize papers, etc.
As verification, processing and transaction takes time, it causes delay to citizens who has to visit government offices each and every time for each step
of process, especially for people who are in emergency.
This process also causes:
- Huge Paperwork
- Extra verification 
- Constant footfalls in offices
- Time Consuming
- Money/Resources exhausting
- Corruption

Solution:

We are creating a blockchain ID for the user that can be merged with the SSOID already given to E-Mitra users. In here, every transaction is recorded and completed very fast
compared to traditional way. 

Where we are implementing it:
- Land
- Health
- E-Mitra normal service payments
- Income Tax
 
- Smart Contract: It ensures fulfillment of transaction, after steps are completed without any extra hassle
- Corruption - Any transfer will take place directly between the citizens and the government without any third party.
- Verification: Blockchain ensures you are the owner of that ID and can buy with that - such as using biometrics and constant bank account
- Time Reduced: People don't have to constantly visit offices
- Less Paperwork
- People can view their properties online and access their whole records which helps them such as:
    - They can pay tax from anywhere in the world such as a person who buys a land in Jaipur but transferred to different place can pay online
- Secure: Blockchain ensures transaction is secure as multiple nodes check the integrity
- Immutable - Nobody can change the records
- Accessible - Records can be accessed whole by private key and just shallow information to the public key.


Software Used:

We are using Django for the backend. Blockchain transactions are mantained by Ethereum using smart contracts.
